# PythonRQR
Simple Reverse QR webapplication in python3 werkzeug/flask

This is a simple page that shows a QR code that allows for anyone to drop a text or link with nothing else.
It uses no database, only logging because... I guess I just felt like it.


Expected files for SSL:

- fullchain.pem
- privkey.pem
    
    
**TODO**
* arguments
  * files in arguments
  * option without https
  * port number
* vcenter QR code
